Problem statement
Create the frontend for a chat application. You can check out the mockups down below.

Instructions
Functionality
Assume you are a dummy logged in user.
Use a json file to load some dummy data in the project.
Search : conversations should be searchable by contact name.
Left sidebar:
Show all the conversations created here
Each conversation should have the contact name and some text of the last message in the chat
Create conversation button
On clicking this open a pop up and load all the contacts (from the dummy data.json/js file).
On clicking the contact should start a new conversation (if no conversation was previously started). Or open the existing conversation for that contact.
Right side view
Show the current selected conversation messages
Send a message in the conversation
Handle errors and success alerts and show appropriate Alert/Notification.
You have to use react-router.
You have to use react hooks ONLY.
Bonus feature: Make the redux data persistent such that after refresh, the messages and conversations are intact.

You are ALLOWED to style the app the way you like. Do whatever you want with the styling. ONLY the functionality should work.
You are ALLOWED to google and read how to approach the problem
DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet
DO NOT cheat with other students, I am trusting you all for this one!
Once you have finished with the test, make a video recording your computer screen (via phone or a software like OBS/screencastify etc) and explaining how you have approached the problem in code and showing the final product. The video can be UPTO 3 mins long. Please donâ€™t record videos longer than that.
Upload the code to github.
Host your code on github (using gh-pages)/netlify/firebase etc.. (This is mandatory)
Once you have recorded the video ,upload it on youtube (unlisted or whatever), drive or wherever you want to upload it. If no video is submitted, the solution will be rejected.
